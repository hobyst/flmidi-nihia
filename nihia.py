    ### Parameters

     - info_type: The kind of information you're going to send as defined on `mixerinfo_types`. ("VOLUME", "PAN"...)
         - Note: If declared as `"EXIST"`, you can also declare the track type on the `value` argument as a string (values are contained in `track_types` dictionary).
    
     - trackID: From 0 to 7. Tells the device which track from the ones that are showing up in the screen you're going to tell info about.

    The third (and last) argument depends on what kind of information you are going to send:

     - value (integer): Can be 0 (no) or 1 (yes). Used for two-state properties like to tell if the track is solo-ed or not (except `"EXIST"`).

     - info: Used for track name, track pan, track volume and the Komplete Kontrol instance ID.

     - peakValues: For peak values. They can be neither integers or floats, and they will get reformated automatically. You can
    also use the `mixer.getTrackPeaks` function directly to fill the argument, but remember you have to specify the left and the right channel separately. You have to 
    report them as a list of values: `peak=[peakL_0, peakR_0, peakL_1, peakR_1 ...]`

    # Compatibility behaviour for older implementations of the layer before the addition of track_types
    # This will retrieve the correct value in case the developer used the string based declaration
    if type(value) == str:
        value = track_types.get(value, 0)
